# SpinTheWheel DS4 (STW)

FirstLight contains the project with OSC messages

IRSensors is the test for IR sensors on the wheel

MPU was the MPU (rotation sensor) based arrow pointing code.

Old contains the FireLeds test and over-the-top server to fully adjust the LED strip. We didnt really use that for LenteFeest as we dont need configuration, but feel free to play with it. I think OSC over UDP (so not TCP) is the easiest to expand.
